DISCLAIMER:

while i am a metaculus staff member, i am not part of the product or development
team.  nothing in here is indicative of the planned design of metaculus; these
are scripts i've made in my own time for my own enjoyment and productivity.
these scripts are provided as-is; if you have any issues in using them, do not
bother metaculus staff members, contact
@[casens](https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/104161/) directly.

these scripts can be used with greasemonkey/tampermonkey or stylus:

* **metaculus_flags.js** - a script that makes deterministically-generated
	avatars styled like flags.  flags are generated on leaderboards and next to
	comments.  live demo
	[here](https://ludant.github.io/flaggy/), screenshots on metaculus [here]() and [here]().

* **metaculus.css** - simple css edits, mostly to make the site as a whole
	narrower, and comments/question text even narrower.

* **metaculus_random.js** - adds a simple button to the header to access
	a random question (including public figure predictions, discussion posts, and
	journals).
